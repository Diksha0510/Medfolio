# Medfolio (A web based application)

Medfolio is an attempt to make the lives of the doctors and general public easy by integrating individual's medical records to Government's ID unique identity number, in our case Aadhar Number. Individuals can feed data to our system, that will be stored in the database and can be retrived when requested, as per use.

## Description

Doctors and Individuals have different registrations pages, which when regsitered will be validated manually (will later automate the proccess) for Aadhar (in case of Individual) and for valid medical registration of Doctors. 

If the user is verified, then both individual and doctors have different priviledges,
* Doctors have options to add/edit medical records and check for any patient's medical records.
* Individual have option to add/edit medical records.

## Technologies Used
* HTML, CSS & Bootstrap Framework for front-end development.
* PHP for backend develpment.
* MySQL for database.
